Hi! I'm a data scientist in training, and I'll be sharing with you some of the datasets that I'm working with right now. Some will be from Kaggle, and others will be open public datasets. My goal is to learn as much as I can along the way, and ultimately I hope to use these data for insights that can help solve a problem. 
I would love to receive any input and comments from you, you can contact me via email and linkedin.
