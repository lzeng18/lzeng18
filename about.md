### Thanks for stopping by!

I'm Linda, a data scientist in training, here in New York City. I've been working data professionally for almost a decade in a wide range of capacities. I finally took the next step and enrolled in grad school to study Information Systems, with a specialization in data analystics and database management. I plan to continue on this journey to become a data scientist, and along the way, I have dabbled in other work as a teacher, a licensed cosmetologist, and a jewelry designer. I am open to career opportunities as a data scientist, data analyst, and business analyst. I would love to hear from you at lindazeng@berkeley.edu.
