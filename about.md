#### Thanks for stopping by!

I'm Linda, a data scientist in training here in New York City. I've been working data professionally for almost a decade in a wide range of capacities. I finally took the next step and enrolled in grad school to study Information Systems, with a specialization in data analystics and database management. Some of the data projects I worked on include helping to replicate a complete ("mini") Amazon (4 million records) database at Pace's Data Lab, training public Citi Bike dataset to predict peak ridership days, and analyzing significant factors in telco churn rate using IBM's Cloudant Platform.  

My hobbies include jewelry making, running, and reading Stephen King novels late into the night. 

I am open to career opportunities as a data scientist, data analyst, and business analyst. I would love to hear from you at lindazeng@berkeley.edu.
